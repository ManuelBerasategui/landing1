Another Day working on the project. I was searching a Lot about the placement of the elements and found out that there it was necessary just to set a max-width to the texto so that ir auto accomodates to the space we wanted it to Fit. Then, the image, I only implemented the famous float: right; function, which automatically setted it besides the texto. Finally, I changed margin to 0 so that both text and image are in the same line.
