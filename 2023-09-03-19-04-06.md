Yes. I've finished landing1. And completely, with the resizing of the elements (that problema I had because of the zoom I was working with in the live server page). Now, started with the second landing page. I'll contin√∫e writing the daily journal here but just for organization. I puta the logo and resized it. Now I attempt to make it faster than the first one, AND eventually, work in a More conplex landing page, Like Spotify for example.
