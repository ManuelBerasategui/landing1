Today was a commiting day. More for filling the squares in green than everything else, I worked on the header of the page, adding the best style I could, for now. Then I'm gonna get 
deeper on it. I also did something that I really liked. See the arrow next to the about button? I took it literally from stack overflow. I just did nothing, but I know that as it works
is how I'll work for many times. Appart from that, nothing else, just reminding to work with the main body tomorrow.
